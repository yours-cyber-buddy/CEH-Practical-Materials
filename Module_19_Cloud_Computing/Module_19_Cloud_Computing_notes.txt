🌩️ Cloud Computing – Overview

Think of cloud computing as “renting computers, networks, and services over the internet” instead of buying and maintaining them yourself.


🔹 What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing delivers IT services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, AI tools, etc.) on demand through the internet, usually on a pay-as-you-go basis.


🔹 Cloud Service Models (SPI Model)

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
You rent hardware: virtual machines, storage, networking.
Example: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VM, Google Compute Engine.
You manage OS, apps, and data.

PaaS (Platform as a Service)
You rent a ready-to-use environment: runtime, database, dev tools.
Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku.
You only manage applications and data, not the underlying OS.

SaaS (Software as a Service)
You rent software apps fully managed by the provider.
Example: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce, Dropbox.
You only use the software—no backend control.


🔹 Cloud Deployment Models

Public Cloud – Owned by third-party providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Private Cloud – Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.
Hybrid Cloud – Mix of public + private.
Community Cloud – Shared by organizations with similar needs (e.g., government agencies).


🔹 Cloud Security Challenges

Data breaches (unauthorized access).
Misconfiguration (leaving S3 buckets open).
Insider threats (employees misusing privileges).
Account hijacking (weak credentials, stolen tokens).
Insecure APIs (exposed cloud APIs can be exploited).
Lack of visibility (difficulty monitoring multi-cloud setups).


🔹 Cloud Security Responsibilities (Shared Responsibility Model)

Cloud Provider is responsible for:
Physical security of servers
Networking hardware
Virtualization platform

Customer is responsible for:
Identity and access management (IAM)
Data security (encryption, backups)
Application security (patching, monitoring)

☁️ Topic 1: Cloud Threats & Vulnerabilities

Think of the cloud like a shared apartment building:

The building (infrastructure) is owned by the landlord (cloud provider).
Tenants (customers) rent rooms (VMs, storage, services).
If one tenant leaves their door open or hacks into another, everyone’s at risk.


🔹 Common Threats in Cloud

Data Breaches
Sensitive data exposed due to misconfigured cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob).
Example: Leaving storage buckets open to the public.

Data Loss
Accidental deletion, ransomware, or cloud outage.
No backup = permanent loss.

Account Hijackin
Stolen cloud credentials (via phishing, brute force, leaked keys).
Attacker gains control of cloud resources.

Insecure APIs
Cloud services rely heavily on APIs. If poorly secured, attackers can exploit them to gain access.

Insider Threats
Malicious or careless employees misusing access rights.

Abuse of Cloud Services
Attackers rent cloud servers to launch DDoS, spam, or crypto mining.

Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
Flooding cloud apps to exhaust resources.

Shared Technology Vulnerabilities
Multi-tenant environments may allow attackers to escape from one VM into another (hypervisor attacks).


🔹 Vulnerabilities in Cloud Systems

Misconfigured cloud storage (S3 buckets, open MongoDB/Elasticsearch).
Weak Identity & Access Management (IAM) (no MFA, excessive privileges).
Unpatched OS or services in cloud-hosted VMs.
Unencrypted data in transit or at rest.
Default credentials left unchanged in cloud apps or databases.

✅ Key Note

The biggest cloud security risk = Misconfiguration.
Example: An S3 bucket with sensitive customer data set to “public”.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☁️ Topic 2: Cloud Attacks

Attackers use many traditional hacking methods (phishing, brute force, malware), but also cloud-specific ones.


🔹 1. Cloud Malware Injection Attack

Attacker uploads a malicious service or VM image into the cloud (pretending it’s legitimate).

When customers use it, attacker gains access to their data or environment.

Example: Injecting a backdoored virtual machine image in AWS Marketplace.


🔹 2. Cloud Account Hijacking

Stealing cloud credentials via:
Phishing
Stolen API keys
Brute force attacks

Once inside, attacker can steal data, spin up resources (crypto mining), or shut down services.


🔹 3. Man-in-the-Cloud (MITC) Attack

Uses cloud synchronization tokens (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive).

Attacker steals the sync token (not password).

Once token is stolen, files sync automatically to attacker’s machine.


🔹 4. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)

Cloud services rely on availability.

Attacker floods apps/servers until they’re unavailable.

Example: Flooding AWS EC2 instance hosting a website.


🔹 5. Side Channel Attacks

Exploiting multi-tenant architecture.

Example: Attackers on the same physical host use CPU cache timing to extract data from another tenant’s VM.


🔹 6. Insider Attacks

Cloud admin or malicious insider abuses privileges.

Example: Admin downloads sensitive data from customer storage.


🔹 7. Sniffing Cloud Traffic

If encryption is weak, attacker can sniff data in transit (between user ↔ cloud).


🔹 8. Misconfiguration Exploits

Attackers scan for open cloud services (S3 buckets, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB).

Tools like Shodan can find these.


✅ Tip

In cloud hacking, the most exam-relevant attacks are:

Malware Injection
MITC (Man-in-the-Cloud)
Account Hijacking
Exploiting Misconfigurations

🌐 Topic 3: Cloud Security Controls

Think of cloud security controls like layers of locks and guards in that shared apartment building analogy we’ve been using:

Threats = robbers, leaks, or mistakes.
Controls = CCTV, locks, security guards, fire alarms.


Cloud security controls are generally divided into three categories:


🔹 1. Preventive Controls
(stop threats before they happen)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) → Enforce strong authentication, MFA, least privilege.

Encryption → Data encrypted at rest (disk, storage) and in transit (SSL/TLS).

Network Security → Firewalls, Security Groups, VPNs.

Configuration Management → Secure defaults, automated tools to catch misconfigs.


🔹 2. Detective Controls
(help you find if something suspicious is happening)

Monitoring and Logging → CloudTrail (AWS), Stackdriver (GCP), Azure Monitor.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) → Alerts on unusual traffic.

SIEM Integration → Centralized log analysis (Splunk, ELK, etc.).


🔹 3. Corrective Controls
(help recover and respond after an incident)

Backups & Snapshots → Quickly restore lost or corrupted data.

Disaster Recovery Plans → Run workloads in multiple regions.

Patch Management → Fix vulnerabilities rapidly.

Incident Response Playbooks → Predefined steps to contain breaches.


🔹 4. Administrative Controls
(human + policy-based)

Security Policies → Define who can do what in the cloud.

User Training → Prevent phishing & insider mistakes.

Third-party Audits → Compliance with standards (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA).


🔹 5. Cloud-native Security Services
(what providers offer to customers)

AWS → GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, Shield.

Azure → Security Center, Sentinel.

GCP → Security Command Center.


📌 In CEH terms →
Cloud security controls = the countermeasures to threats & attacks in cloud.

☁️ Topic 4: Cloud Penetration Testing (Overview)

Pen testing in the cloud is not the same as testing your own on-prem network. Because in cloud you don’t own the infrastructure, you share it with others. That means you must follow the provider’s rules.


🔹 1. Cloud Pen Testing Approaches

a) External Pen Testing

Test from the internet, just like an outsider/attacker.
Example: Testing exposed services like S3 buckets, APIs, storage endpoints, VPN gateways.

b) Internal Pen Testing

Testing from inside the cloud environment (after you gain access).
Example: Once in a compromised VM, checking lateral movement, privilege escalation.

c) Application-Level Pen Testing

Focus on web apps, APIs, mobile apps hosted in the cloud.
Example: SQL injection in a cloud-hosted DB, insecure API endpoints.

d) Cloud Configuration Review

Looking for misconfigured IAM roles, storage permissions, security groups.
Example: Publicly writable S3 buckets, overly permissive firewall rules.


🔹 2. Challenges in Cloud Pen Testing

Authorization Required → You must get written permission from provider & client (testing without permission can violate laws).

Shared Responsibility → You test only what belongs to the client (apps, data, configs), not the underlying hardware.

Dynamic Nature → Cloud resources scale up/down; IPs can change.

Multi-tenancy → Can’t touch other tenants’ resources by mistake.

Limited Tools → Some scanning tools may be blocked by provider firewalls.


🔹 3. Key Tools for Cloud Pen Testing

ScoutSuite → Multi-cloud auditing tool (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Prowler → AWS security best practices checker.

Pacu → AWS exploitation framework.

CloudSploit → Cloud security posture management.

Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP → Web/API testing.


📌 In CEH exam, expect questions like:

“Which cloud pen testing approach allows testing of client’s applications only?” → Application-level.
“Why is pen testing restricted in cloud?” → Shared responsibility & legal agreements.

☁️ Topic 5: Cloud Security Best Practices

These are the defensive measures organizations follow to secure cloud environments. Think of them as the "Golden Rules" for cloud safety.


🔹 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Enforce least privilege (give minimum permissions needed).

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts.

Regularly rotate access keys and passwords.

Avoid using root/admin accounts for daily tasks.


🔹 2. Data Protection

Encrypt data at rest (storage) and in transit (network).

Use provider services like AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS for key management.

Classify data → Sensitive vs. Non-sensitive, and apply controls accordingly.


🔹 3. Network Security

Configure security groups / firewalls properly (block by default, allow minimal).

Use VPN or private endpoints instead of exposing services directly.

Deploy IDS/IPS, WAF (Web Application Firewall) for cloud apps.

Segment networks using VPCs, subnets, and NACLS.


🔹 4. Monitoring & Logging

Enable cloud provider logging:

AWS → CloudTrail, GuardDuty

Azure → Monitor, Security Center

GCP → Cloud Audit Logs

Monitor for suspicious logins, API calls, privilege escalation attempts.

Use SIEM integration for centralized log analysis.


🔹 5. Backup & Disaster Recovery

Take regular backups and test recovery.

Use multi-region replication for high availability.

Implement incident response plans for cloud breaches.


🔹 6. Compliance & Governance

Follow compliance standards: ISO 27017, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR (depending on business).

Use cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools to check misconfigurations.


📌 CEH Exam Focus:

Expect questions like:

“What is the best way to minimize over-permissioning in cloud?” → Least privilege principle.

“Which AWS service provides logging of API calls?” → CloudTrail.

“Which practice ensures data confidentiality?” → Encryption.
