
HACKING WIRELESS NETWORKS:


üîπ Step 1: Basics of Wireless Networks

Think of Wi-Fi like a walkie-talkie party where devices talk to each other through invisible radio waves instead of wires.

Each Wi-Fi network is an Access Point (AP) (like the DJ of the party).

Devices (laptops, phones) are clients that connect to the AP.

The communication happens over 802.11 standards (the Wi-Fi rulebook).

üì∂ Wi-Fi Standards (802.11 family):

802.11a ‚Äì Old, 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps.

802.11b ‚Äì Old, 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps.

802.11g ‚Äì 2.4 GHz, up to 54 Mbps.

802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) ‚Äì 2.4 & 5 GHz, up to 600 Mbps.

802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) ‚Äì 5 GHz, gigabit speeds.

802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E) ‚Äì Latest, works on 2.4/5/6 GHz, faster and more secure.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


üîπ Step 2: Wireless Security Protocols

These are the locks on the Wi-Fi door:

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

Oldest, uses weak RC4 encryption.

Easily broken with tools in minutes.

Like using a rusty lock on your house.

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

Temporary improvement over WEP.

Still weak; can be cracked with dictionary/brute-force attacks.

WPA2

Stronger AES encryption (CCMP).

Still vulnerable if a weak password is used (dictionary attacks).

WPA3

Latest and strongest.

Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals).

Much harder to crack, but not fully immune.
          WPA3: what‚Äôs still attackable?

WPA3 fixes most offline cracking, but two important angles remain:

1. Transition-mode downgrade (WPA3/WPA2 mixed mode)

If an SSID allows both WPA3-SAE and WPA2-PSK, clients can be tricked to connect with WPA2. Then you capture a normal WPA2 handshake/PMKID and run a dictionary attack. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù WPA3; it abuses mixed mode. Mitigation: disable transition mode; enable PMF as Required. 


2. Protocol/implementation issues that affect WPA3 too

FragAttacks (frame fragmentation/aggregation design flaws) allow limited frame injection/forgery on protected Wi-Fi. Not a PSK crack, but can aid data exfiltration or traffic manipulation. Patch devices/firmware. 


Dragonblood (SAE side-channels) enabled password partitioning and downgrades on early WPA3; vendors shipped fixes (SAE ‚ÄúH2E‚Äù, constant-time). Keep firmware updated and avoid weak groups/transition mode. 

Note on deauth: WPA3 mandates Protected Management Frames (PMF/802.11w), so classic deauth/disassoc attacks should fail when PMF is Required. (You can still RF-jam the channel.) 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


üîπ Step 3: Wireless Threats


Step-by-step: common Wi-Fi threats (how they actually play out)

1) Rogue Access Point (inside a company)

Goal: Plant an AP on the internal LAN so victims join ‚Äútrusted‚Äù Wi-Fi and their traffic exits through your box.
You need: Small AP or laptop (hostapd/Wi-Fi Pineapple), upstream Internet/NAT.

Steps:

1.Survey the environment (SSIDs, channels, security).

2.Cable your rogue AP to an internal port (or tether to 4G).

3.Clone the corporate SSID name (don‚Äôt reuse their security if you‚Äôre just providing open guest bait), set same channel or adjacent with stronger signal.

4.DHCP/NAT on the rogue box; enable logging/forward proxy if testing inspection.

5.Observe who associates; monitor DNS/HTTP to demonstrate risk (never collect creds unless explicitly in scope).

Why it works: Users auto-join familiar names; poor NAC/port security.

Stops: 802.1X port-security, wireless NAC, RF monitoring, unique SSIDs per band/VLAN, client allowlists.




2) Evil Twin (look-alike AP)

Goal: Lure clients to your stronger clone of a real SSID.
You need: AP card that supports AP mode, better signal than the real AP, and (optionally) a captive portal phishing page.

Steps:

1.Recon SSID, BSSID, channel, security.

2.Broadcast same SSID on same channel with higher power.

3.(Legacy) Send deauths to force roam; WPA3+PMF blocks these, so use signal lure or mild RF jamming instead.

4.For WPA2-Personal: you won‚Äôt ‚Äúsniff‚Äù the PSK from the twin; instead you can phish on a fake captive portal, or (if the real SSID is in transition mode) force WPA2 and capture a crackable handshake.

5.For WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise: run a fake RADIUS (e.g., EAP-PEAP/MSCHAPv2) to capture challenges for offline cracking if clients don‚Äôt validate server certs.

Stops: Disable transition mode; enforce PMF=Required; HSTS/HTTPS with cert pinning; EAP-TLS with strict server-cert validation.




3) Packet sniffing (Wireshark/airodump): can you see ‚Äúeverything‚Äù?

Short answer:

As a normal connected client, you see your unicast + broadcast/multicast. You don‚Äôt see other clients‚Äô unicast frames.

To capture all frames on a channel you need monitor mode. To decrypt protected traffic you also need the keys.

You need: Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode, Linux/macOS, airmon-ng/airodump-ng or Wireshark.

Steps (802.11 capture)

1.Put the card in monitor mode: airmon-ng start wlan0 ‚Üí interface like wlan0mon.

2.Lock to the target channel: airodump-ng -c 6 wlan0mon (or choose the AP‚Äôs channel).

3.Capture with airodump-ng or Wireshark on the monitor interface.

4.Decrypting traffic:

     WEP: immediate if you have enough IVs (legacy).

     WPA2-PSK: you need the PSK and a captured 4-way handshake (or PMKID) to decrypt in Wireshark.

     WPA3-SAE: you need the password and the SAE/4-way handshakes; without that, traffic stays opaque. Past       captures remain safe due to PFS.

     If the SSID is in transition mode and you coerce WPA2, you can decrypt like WPA2 after cracking the PSK.

Stops: Use strong passwords, disable transition mode, require PMF, keep clients/APs patched (FragAttacks).



4) Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Goal: Intercept/alter traffic.
You need: Position ‚Äúin the path‚Äù (rogue AP/evil twin), or L2 attacks on open networks.

Steps:

1.Open or captive networks: ARP spoof/redirect to your gateway; run mitmproxy/Bettercap to inspect HTTP.

2.Encrypted PSK networks: become the AP (evil twin/rogue portal). You can‚Äôt decrypt existing client sessions without keys, so you typically phish credentials or proxy new HTTP.

3.Enterprise (EAP-PEAP/MSCHAPv2): evil twin a RADIUS and harvest challenge/response if clients skip server-cert validation; attempt offline crack.

4.Modern web limits: HSTS/HTTPS makes SSL-strip ineffective; focus on captive-portal gullibility or misconfigurations.

Stops: HTTPS everywhere, strict EAP server-cert validation/EAP-TLS, disable auto-join, DNS-over-HTTPS on clients.



5) DoS / Jamming

Goal: Knock clients/APs offline or force roaming.
You need: Any 2.4/5 GHz transmitter; tools like mdk4 for management-frame floods.

Steps

1.Legacy deauth/disassoc floods: trivial on WPA2/Open.

2.WPA3 + PMF: deauth frames are protected ‚Üí attack is blocked; RF jamming (noise) still works but is illegal in many countries.

3.Beacon/probe floods can cause instability; targeted channel jamming causes disconnections.

Stops: PMF=Required, band steering, spectrum analysis & WIPS to locate jammers; lawful reporting.



6) Replay

Goal: Resend captured frames to cause actions.

Reality: WPA2/WPA3 include replay protection via sequence numbers. Only certain implementation/standard flaws (e.g., FragAttacks) allow for limited forged/injected frames. Patch all gear.



7) Password attacks (WEP/WPA2/WPA3)

WEP: capture IVs ‚Üí crack with Aircrack-ng/WEPCrack/WepAttack in minutes.

WPA2-PSK: capture 4-way or PMKID, then dictionary attack (Aircrack-ng/Hashcat/Pyrit).

WPA3-SAE: no general offline crack; only feasible when:

SSID is in transition mode ‚Üí downgrade to WPA2 and crack; or

specific Dragonblood-style side-channel or unpatched implementations.
Use long, random passphrases regardless.

Wireless Hacking Methodology


üîπ Step 1: Reconnaissance (Discovering Wireless Networks)

Goal: Identify available wireless networks in the area.

How it‚Äôs done:
Scanning for SSIDs (network names), BSSIDs (MAC addresses), channel numbers, and signal strength.
Detecting whether the network uses WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3.

Tools:
airodump-ng (from Aircrack suite)
Kismet (passive network discovery) 
inSSIDer (Windows Wi-Fi discovery tool)

üëâ Example command (with Airodump-ng):      
                                       airodump-ng wlan0

 This will show all nearby wireless networks, their encryption, and connected clients.


üîπ Step 2: Recon of Clients (Finding Connected Devices)

Goal: Identify devices (laptops, phones, IoT devices) connected to target Wi-Fi.

Why? Because attacking through a connected client is sometimes easier than directly cracking the router.

Tools:

       airodump-ng --bssid <target BSSID> --channel <CH> wlan0

üëâ Example:
             airodump-ng --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 --channel 6 wlan0

  This shows all devices connected to that AP.



üîπ Step 3: Packet Sniffing (Capturing Traffic)

Goal: Capture packets from the wireless network for later analysis.

Tools:

      Wireshark (GUI traffic analyzer)

      tcpdump (CLI packet capture)

Requirement: You need a wireless adapter in monitor mode.

Process:

        Capture handshakes (WPA/WPA2/WPA3 authentication traffic).

        Capture data frames (if encryption is weak, like WEP).

üëâ Example with Airodump-ng:
                             airodump-ng --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 --channel 6 -w capture wlan0

This will save captured packets into a file (capture.cap) for cracking later.



üîπ Step 4: Attacking (Different Techniques Based on Encryption)

WEP Attacks: Use IV (Initialization Vector) weaknesses to crack the key.

WPA/WPA2 Attacks: Capture 4-way handshake and then crack using a dictionary attack (aircrack-ng).

WPA3 Attacks:
 More secure, but vulnerable to:
              Dragonblood attack (downgrade WPA3 ‚Üí WPA2, side-channel leaks).
              Rogue AP attacks.

Rogue AP / Evil Twin: Hacker sets up a fake AP with the same SSID to trick users into connecting.

Deauthentication Attack: Disconnects users so they reconnect, forcing a handshake capture.

üëâ Example (Deauth attack with Aireplay-ng):
                                              aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <BSSID> -c <Client_MAC> wlan0
This sends 10 deauthentication packets to a client, disconnecting it.



üîπ Step 5: Gaining Access

Once the password (PSK) is cracked, or a rogue AP is successful, attacker connects to the network.

They can now sniff all traffic, launch Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and scan internal systems.



üîπ Step 6: Post-Exploitation

Escalate attacks by:

Capturing sensitive traffic (username/passwords, cookies).

Pivoting to internal machines.

Setting up backdoors or maintaining persistence.


‚ö° So in summary, the wireless hacking methodology is:
Recon ‚Üí Client Discovery ‚Üí Packet Sniffing ‚Üí Attacking (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3/Evil Twin) ‚Üí Gaining Access ‚Üí Post-Exploitation

üîê Wireless Countermeasures


1. Rogue Access Points (Evil Twin)

Threat Recap: Attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi AP with same SSID to trick users.

Countermeasures:

              Deploy Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS) (e.g., AirMagnet, Aruba, Cisco WIPS).

              Enforce 802.1X authentication (Enterprise WPA2/WPA3).

              Conduct regular Rogue AP Scans.

              Train users to verify SSIDs and use VPN when on Wi-Fi.



2. Packet Sniffing (Wireshark, tcpdump)

Threat Recap: Attacker captures unencrypted wireless traffic.

Countermeasures:

                Always use WPA3 (SAE) or at least WPA2-AES (never WEP).

                Implement end-to-end encryption (HTTPS, TLS, VPN).

		Disable open Wi-Fi networks in corporate environments.



3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Threat Recap: Hacker intercepts communication between victim & AP.

Countermeasures:

		Use certificate pinning & HSTS in applications.

		Enable Mutual Authentication in enterprise Wi-Fi (EAP-TLS).

		Implement VPN tunneling for all sensitive communication.



4. Password Cracking (Dictionary, Brute Force, WPA handshake attacks)

Threat Recap: Attackers capture WPA/WPA2/WPA3 handshakes & crack them.

Countermeasures:

		Enforce strong, complex Wi-Fi passwords (16+ characters, random).

		Use WPA3-Enterprise where possible.

		Limit failed login attempts (EAP methods).



5. Denial of Service (Deauthentication, Jamming)

Threat Recap: Hacker sends deauth frames or jams frequency.

Countermeasures:

		Use Management Frame Protection (802.11w) to prevent deauth attacks.

		Deploy spectrum analyzers to detect jamming.

		Configure WIPS auto-shutdown on detection.



6. Replay Attacks

Threat Recap: Captured packets are retransmitted to gain access.

Countermeasures:

		Use WPA3 with SAE (prevents replay attacks).

		Enable session tokens & timestamps in applications.

		Use intrusion detection systems to monitor anomalies.



7. WPS Attacks (PIN Cracking)

Threat Recap: Weak WPS PIN allows attackers to connect.

Countermeasures:

		Disable WPS completely.

		Use manual WPA key entry instead of WPS.



‚úÖ Golden Rule:

             Always prefer WPA3-Enterprise (EAP-TLS) + VPN + WIDS/WIPS for corporate networks.

             For home use, WPA3-Personal with a long random password is sufficient.
